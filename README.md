# Aaron-Portfolio
Challenge 2 - Build a portfolio website

## Task
- Make a responsive website that showcases my potential portfolio
- Include links to past projects, and incorporate an about, work, and contact section
- Use what we've learned in bootcamp to incorporate visually appealing and interactive features

## What I Learned
- I learned a great deal about CSS features and how to deploy them
- I learned how to cleanly and logically write HTML that is structured in a way that flows with CSS
- I learned that flex boxes can drive a man crazy (haha ;)

## Check Out My Page
